# Festival-Simulation-Using-Intelligent-Agents
Final project for the course ID2209 Distributed Artificial Intelligence and Intelligent Agents as a part of the Masters Program in Software Engineering of Distributed Systems at KTH.

The Main purpose of this project is to simulate a festival with different types of guests wherein we get to observe their interactions and behaviour as a result of their traits and personality values. When different agents meet in such a manner what would be the expected outcome? In addition to their traits even the location where the agents meet can influence how they behave in the situation.
